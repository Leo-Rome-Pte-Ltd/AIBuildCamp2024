# Lesson 4: Working with Firestore and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Introduction to Firestore as a Database: Set up Firestore for storing and retrieving data efficiently, both as a document and vector database.
* ​Implementing RAG: Learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and integrate it to enhance AI responses with real-time, relevant data from Firestore.
* ​Brainstorming and Project Idea Sharing: Each team will share their project concepts with mentors and peers, receiving feedback to refine their approach.
* ​Structuring Your AI Application: Tips on structuring data, APIs, and components to optimize performance, reliability, and scalability.

​Outcome: Each team will have a RAG-powered data retrieval setup with Firestore, ready for personalized responses, and a finalized project concept with mentor feedback.
