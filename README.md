We will publish all the content related to AI BuildCamp 2024 on this website.

Here is the content outline for the 5 lessons

### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Generative AI and Getting Started with Firebase**

* ​Overview of Generative AI: Discuss the fundamentals of generative AI, exploring applications across industries, and how it adds value in real-world use cases.
* ​Why Gemini?: Dive into the strengths of Google’s Gemini model, highlighting its unique advantages in AI-powered applications.
* ​Firebase and Google Cloud for AI-driven development, why it’s better than other options like Vercel or Netlify.
* ​Project Planning and Ideation: Initial brainstorming of project ideas that leverage the power of AI for real-world problems.

\
**Outcome**: Participants will gain a strong understanding of generative AI and have Firebase fully set up and ready for application development.\


### Lesson 2: **Creating and Deploying the Frontend with Firebase Hosting and Authentication**

* ​Getting Started with Cursor IDE: Introduction to Cursor IDE for streamlined and efficient development with integrated AI coding assistance.
* ​Developing a Single Page Application (SPA): Hands-on building of a basic, responsive SPA using ReactJS and structured components for a cohesive UI.
* ​Firebase Hosting: Deploy the SPA on Firebase Hosting, making the frontend live and accessible.
* ​Implementing Firebase Authentication: Integrate Google SSO with Firebase Authentication to enable secure, user-friendly onboarding.

​**Outcome**: By the end of Lesson 2, each team will have a hosted frontend with Firebase Authentication set up, enabling user sign-ins with Google SSO.

\
**Lesson 3: Building a Serverless Backend with Firebase Functions**

* ​Introduction to Firebase Functions: Understanding serverless architecture and how Firebase Functions can serve as the backend.
* ​Setting Up Backend Logic: Create and deploy Firebase Functions to handle backend tasks, like processing requests and handling AI interactions.
* ​Connecting Frontend and Backend: Establish communication between the frontend SPA and Firebase Functions to complete the app’s core functionality.
* ​Basic Data Processing with Firebase Functions: Implement data handling techniques within Firebase Functions for seamless AI-powered responses.

​**Outcome**: Teams will have a functional serverless backend connected to their frontend, enabling interactions and data processing.

**Lesson 4: Working with Firestore and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

* ​Introduction to Firestore as a Database: Set up Firestore for storing and retrieving data efficiently, both as a document and vector database.
* ​Implementing RAG: Learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and integrate it to enhance AI responses with real-time, relevant data from Firestore.
* ​Brainstorming and Project Idea Sharing: Each team will share their project concepts with mentors and peers, receiving feedback to refine their approach.
* ​Structuring Your AI Application: Tips on structuring data, APIs, and components to optimize performance, reliability, and scalability.

​**Outcome**: Each team will have a RAG-powered data retrieval setup with Firestore, ready for personalized responses, and a finalized project concept with mentor feedback.

\
**Lesson 5: Team Project Presentations and Final Feedback**

* ​Project Presentations: Each team presents their AI-powered application, showcasing the key features, AI integrations, and overall user experience.
* ​Feedback from Mentors and Peers: Get insights and constructive feedback on project implementation, scalability, and presentation skills.
* ​Tips and Best Practices: Instructors and mentors share additional tips for building scalable AI applications and insights on entering the AI tech industry.
* ​Next Steps: Guidance on deploying, iterating, and expanding AI applications for real-world users or potential product launch.

​**Outcome**: Teams will complete the course with a working, AI-powered application and feedback from industry mentors, preparing them for further development or deployment.
